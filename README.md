# Carbon-Emission-Prediction-Model
## Logistics Carbon Emission Prediction System is a machine learning–based web application designed to analyze and predict carbon emissions generated during logistics and transportation activities.

### The project focuses on:

1. Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand emission patterns
2. Training and evaluating multiple regression models
3. Deploying the final model through a Flask-based web interface for real-time predictions
4. Users can input logistics-related parameters such as transport mode, origin, destination, weather conditions, season, and product type to estimate carbon emissions (in kilotonnes).
5. This project demonstrates the complete ML lifecycle — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model deployment.
