# Carbon-Emission-Prediction-Model
Logistics Carbon Emission Prediction System is a machine learning–based web application designed to analyze and predict carbon emissions generated during logistics and transportation activities.

The project focuses on:

Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand emission patterns

Training and evaluating multiple regression models

Deploying the final model through a Flask-based web interface for real-time predictions

Users can input logistics-related parameters such as transport mode, origin, destination, weather conditions, season, and product type to estimate carbon emissions (in kilotonnes).

This project demonstrates the complete ML lifecycle — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model deployment.
